Scripts to calculate p vs V plots for different temperature. 
Usage:

1. Set st and vpol in DEFINITIONS.txt. 
   st is the interaction strength in kB T units, so if the interaction is temperature independent, st = A.T
2. python3 run_iso.py
3. python3 calc_iso.py "vsol" "temp"
4. "vsol" should match the value of vsol used in DEFINITIONS.txt
   "temp" is the temperature in K, if st = A.T was used, then "temp" should match T.
